# stochastic-optimisation-using-gaussian-mixture-model
R code for stochastic optimisation using GMM.

I struck with this idea while I was taking a course in stichastic optimisation.
Here, a gaaussian mixture model is used to sample down the global minima/maxima.
By intuition, its clear that for a continuous (not neccessary differentiable) function, the program will converge to gloabl maxima/minima with probability one. 
However, I am still in process to prove it mathematically.
basic visualization is also provided in the code for few benchmark optmisation functions.
